## PyProtein
**Disclaimer**: This is not medical advice, consult with your health care practitioner before making any changes to your diet.
PyProtein is simple program to workout how much protein you should be eating based on your bodyweight. Particularly for athletes, 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight is seen as a golden standard and general good recommendation. A little below or a little above may be better suited for a specific individual but overall there is a lot of research supporting this golden standard. Many people are not eating enough protein and this may be a helpful way to get a sense of how close or far off your are from eating the amount of protein that is recommended.

**Values**:
For the values I asked ChatGPT-4 to generate a range of the average servings that are commonly served at a restaurant for each food item that I have in the program (tofu, beef steak, nuts, chicken, yogurt, milk, protein shake (whey), eggs, and fish.  Then for each food item I chose the lower end of the serving size that it returned and then ask it for the protein in that food item of that portion size.  
It’s not perfect but it’s quite close when I looked up nutritional information from government guidelines in some academic research papers. But the serving sizes do differ from country to country and many factors affect the amount of protein and quality of the amino acids of a given protein. There are factors such as bioavailability of protein in a given food. The protein also differences based on cooking method and so on.
This was mainly for me to practice writing Python code and should be taken with a grain of salt.
